<p>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is an American interactive computer-animated preschool television series which was the first Mickey Mouse and computer-animated program for preschoolers. It aired from May 5, 2006, to November 6, 2016 on the Disney Channel.Produced by Disney Television Animation, the series was created by Disney veteran Bobs Gannaway. 126 episodes were produced.</p>
<p>Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and Pluto interact with the viewer to stimulate problem solving during each episode's story.
</p><p>
Once the problem of the episode has been explained, Mickey invites the viewers to join him at the Mousekedoer, a giant Mickey-head-shaped computer whose main function is to distribute the day's Mouseketools, a collection of objects needed to solve the day's problem, to Mickey.
</p><p>
One of them is a "Mystery Mouseketool" represented by a Question Mark, in which, when the words "Mystery Mouseketool" are said, the question mark changes into the Mouseketool the viewer gets to use. Another one is a "Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool "Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling "Oh, Toodles!" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.[4][5] Rhymes are used throughout the show. For example, in "Mickey's Silly Problem", when the "Silly switch" turned on, Mickey for some reason, spoke in rhymes for half of the episode.
</p><p>
The show features two original songs performed by American alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, including the opening theme song, in which a variant of a Mickey Mouse Club chant ("Meeska Mooska Mickey Mouse!") is used to summon the Clubhouse. They Might Be Giants also perform the song used at the end of every episode, "Hot Dog!", which echoes Mickey's first spoken words in the 1929 short The Karnival Kid.</p><p>

This is the first time that the major Disney characters have regularly appeared on television in computer-animated form. The characters previously appeared in CG form in 2003 at the Magic Kingdom theme park attraction Mickey's PhilharMagic, and then appeared in the 2004 direct-to-video special Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas.
</p><p>
After the show ended in 2016, it was succeeded by Mickey and the Roadster Racers (later renamed Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures), which ran from 2017 to 2021, and Mickey Mouse Funhouse, which started in 2021.</p>
